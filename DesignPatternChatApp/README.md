# #5 Factory pattern  

Explain your design decisions. In particular, explain which design pattern(s) you selected
and why.

We have selected the factory pattern, beacause we want to deliver multiple "products" with regards to the user interface and options.

â€¢ Explain how the feature selection works from the user perspective.

Feature selections works by adding these features to the factory. The feature factory controlls the features. Currently only the color of the chat and nickname feature are controllable via the feature factory.
