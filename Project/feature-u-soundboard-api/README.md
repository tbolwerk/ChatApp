# Instructions

## Database

You can run `npm run db-gen` to initialize the database. If more tables need to be added then this can be done in the `./genDb.ts` file. If you want to clean the db then just delete the `./soundboard.db` file and generate the database again.

## Run program

To run the program use `npm run start`.
